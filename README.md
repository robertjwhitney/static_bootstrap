STRAP 'EM UP!
=============================

Static Bootstrap is a nanoc site with support for Haml3, Sass3, Nanoc Fuel, and currently Nutils (for Sass3 @import support).  It also includes a YUI compressor filter for JS.  Sass is minified using the built in output format.

It also has a growing library of assets aside from that, to help speed up development.

Usage
