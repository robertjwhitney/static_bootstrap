STRAP 'EM UP!
=============================

Static Bootstrap is a nanoc site with support for Haml3, Sass3, and some useful helpers from the Nanoc Fuel gem.  It also includes a YUI compressor filter for JS.  Sass is minified using the built in output format.

It also has a growing library of assets aside from that, to help speed up development.
